## 🔐 Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **npm audit**: Additional dependency checks  
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security rules
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated security workflows

### Code Quality

- **No console.log in production**: Blocked by ESLint
- **Structured logging**: All logs saved to Supabase
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
